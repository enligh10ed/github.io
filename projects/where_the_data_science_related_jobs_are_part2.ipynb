    "This post is a continuation of [Where the data science jobs are (part 1)](https://github.com/sedeh/github.io/blob/master/projects/where_the_data_science_related_jobs_are_part1.ipynb). In this installment, we're going to analyze the dataset we downloaded and cleaned in part 1. The dataset contains job information about non-U.S. workers. When a U.S. company wants to hire a foreign worker, the company is required to file a work visa (H1B) or permanent residencey (green card) application with the U.S. Department of Labor. As part of the application, the company must disclose how much U.S. workers in similar jobs are being paid. This is called `Prevailing Wage`. The dataset only contains H1B data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can take advantage of this information to gain insights into the general U.S. job market. Specifically, we're going to look at data science related jobs. Assuming the prevailing wage theory is true, U.S. companies hire foreign workers because there are no qualified U.S. applicants to fill the roles. So a company that hires foreign workers likely also hires many U.S. workers. After all, they only hired non-U.S. workers becauses they have exhausted the pool of qualified U.S. applicants.\n",
    "\n",
    "In part 1, we downloaded, cleaned and enriched the dataset. Now, let's probe the dataset. The dataset contains the following fields that are relevant to our current analysis."
